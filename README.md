# Competitive-Programming

This repository is used to store the algorithms that are frequently required in programming contests (where third party code published before the contest can be used). You can only find algorithms that are hard to code. For example, many Dynamic programming algorithms cannot be found here as they are more of idea based.
If you want to explore more and want to know more competitive programming algorithms, refer https://cp-algorithms.com/.

Warning: If two people or more people used the same algorithm from above in a live contest, there is a chance (depending on the algorithms used) that the submissions will be plagged. So, it's recommended to mention the source in comments of the code to make manual checkers understand the situation.
